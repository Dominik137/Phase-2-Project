            <h1 className="">Welcome to SongSynth! At SongSynth we wanted to give users the 
            ability to access data connected to their Spotify account. We wanted to be able to provide a unique set of 
            data to access from a user's account and the ability to store that data locally! (That is coming soon...)

            However! you can search through artists on Spotify, Access their albums and songs, and save those locally. As well as 
            Access your playlists!
