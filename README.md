Song Synth is a React App that uses the Spotify API to be able to search for any artist on Spotify. You can select the artist and see all their albums and from there you can select those albums and see all the songs. You can select a part of the artist card, album card, or song card and get redirected to that specific artist, album, or song on Spotify. You can also save any Artist, song, or album locally on a different route titled "my-saves".

You can also pull up your Spotify profile and be redirected to your account on click to Spotify. This function also exists with a user's playlists!
